# Advent of Code 2023

## Day 1

### [Part 1](day1a.rs)

Same approach as Python; for each line, we filter for numeric digits.

### [Part 2](day1b.rs)

Also same approach as Python; we use KMP algorithm to compute all substring matches, combine tuples of indices and digit
values, sort the resulting array, then compute the final value.

## Day 2

### [Part 1](day2a.rs)

Same approach as Python. Rust iterators allow us to make use of `flat_map`.

### [Part 2](day2b.rs)

Also same approach as Python.

## Day 3
